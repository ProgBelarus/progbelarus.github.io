Hi! I am George Noarov, a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania fortunate to be advised by [Michael Kearns](https://cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns) and [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/). Prior to this, I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a B.A. in Mathematics from [Princeton University](https://math.princeton.edu), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Mark Braverman](https://mbraverm.princeton.edu/) and [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and machine learning. My current research develops techniques for fair, reliable and trustworthy ML and distribution-free uncertainty quantification. I also work on algorithmic game theory and online learning.

Throughout my academic journey, I have participated in enriching research programs and industry internships, including as a [visiting graduate student](https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/georgy-noarov) in the semester-long [Data-Driven Decision Processes Program](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/DataDriven2022) at the [Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, UC Berkeley](https://simons.berkeley.edu), and as an intern at Goldman Sachs.

In 2023, I am thrilled to be funded by an [Amazon Fellowship for Research in Trustworthy AI](https://www.amazon.science/news-and-features/amazon-provides-gift-to-10-penn-engineering-phd-students-for-work-on-trustworthy-ai). I am also grateful to be the recipient of several academic awards, including the [Undergraduate Award in Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/news/2020-undergraduate-program-award-winners-announced) and Princeton's [Shapiro Prize for Academic Excellence](https://odoc.princeton.edu/faculty-staff/shapiro-prize-academic-excellence), and fellowships, including a Joseph Henry Summer Fellowship. I am also a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi honor societies.

To learn more about my research, you can navigate to the [Publications](/publications) page or my [Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=P0-hDecAAAAJ).

<p style="text-align:center;"> <bf> I am on the job market this year (2025-2026)! </bf> </p>
