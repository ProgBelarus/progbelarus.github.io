Hi! I am George Noarov, a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania fortunate to be advised by [Michael Kearns](https://cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns) and [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/). Prior to this, I graduated Magna Cum Laude with a B.A. in Mathematics from [Princeton University](https://math.princeton.edu), where I was fortunate to be advised by [Mark Braverman](https://mbraverm.princeton.edu/) and [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).

I am broadly interested in the intersection of computer science, statistics and ML, and economics. My research focuses on AI/ML-driven decision-making and on uncertainty quantification, spanning predictive and generative AI. In particular, I develop methodology for provable and robust calibration of model uncertainties. In conjunction with this, I leverage game theory and optimization to enable robust data-driven decision-making in strategic, sequential environments and under distribution shift. My agenda is informed by, and builds tools for, Responsible AI, in that I aim to develop trustworthy, reliable, and fair models.

Throughout my academic journey, I have participated in enriching research programs and industry internships, including as a [visiting graduate student](https://simons.berkeley.edu/people/georgy-noarov) in the semester-long [Data-Driven Decision Processes Program](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/DataDriven2022) at the [Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, UC Berkeley](https://simons.berkeley.edu), and as a quant intern at [Goldman Sachs](https://www.goldmansachs.com/). I spent the summer-fall of 2024 and of 2025 as an Applied Scientist intern at [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/).

My research has been generously supported by an [Amazon Fellowship for Research in Trustworthy AI](https://www.amazon.science/news-and-features/amazon-provides-gift-to-10-penn-engineering-phd-students-for-work-on-trustworthy-ai). I am also grateful to be the recipient of several academic awards, including Princeton's [Shapiro Prize for Academic Excellence](https://odoc.princeton.edu/faculty-staff/shapiro-prize-academic-excellence) and the [Undergraduate Award in Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/news/2020-undergraduate-program-award-winners-announced), and fellowships, including a Joseph Henry Summer Fellowship. I am a member of the [Phi Beta Kappa](https://www.pbk.org/) and [Sigma Xi](https://www.sigmaxi.org/) honor societies.

I have been an enthusiastic teaching assistant, tutor, and grader for over 10 courses throughout my career at Penn and at Princeton, and am very proud to be the recipient of the SEAS Outstanding Teaching Award for my teaching at Penn. I also worked at Princeton's [McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning](https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/), and volunteered as an instructor for the Princeton Splash program organized by the [Pace Center for Civic Engagement](https://pace.princeton.edu/).

In my free time, I enjoy singing and exploring the math of my and my friends' vocalizations, hiking in the mountains, and immersing myself in the atmosphere of bookstores and farmers' markets.
