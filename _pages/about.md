Hi! My name is George Noarov, I am a 3rd year CS PhD student at the University of Pennsylvania fortunate to be advised by [Michael Kearns](https://cis.upenn.edu/~mkearns) and [Aaron Roth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~aaroth/). Before coming to Penn, I graduated Magna Cum Laude from Princeton University with a BA in Mathematics, and was fortunate to be mentored by [Mark Braverman](https://mbraverm.princeton.edu/) and [Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/).

I am broadly interested in theoretical computer science and machine learning. My current focus is on fairness in ML and distribution-free uncertainty quantification (in particular, conformal prediction), as well as on algorithmic game theory and online learning.

Throughout my academic journey, I have participated in several enriching research visits and industry internships, including as a visiting graduate student for the [Data-Driven Decision Processes semester at Simons Institute, Berkeley](https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/DataDriven2022), and as an intern at Goldman Sachs.

I am grateful to be the recipient of several academic awards, including the [Undergraduate Award in Applied and Computational Mathematics](https://www.pacm.princeton.edu/news/2020-undergraduate-program-award-winners-announced) and Princeton's [Shapiro Prize for Academic Excellence](https://odoc.princeton.edu/faculty-staff/shapiro-prize-academic-excellence), and fellowships, including a Joseph Henry Summer Fellowship. I am also a member of the Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi honor societies.
