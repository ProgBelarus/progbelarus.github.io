I greatly enjoy and am passionate about teaching, and have been a teaching assistant, tutor, and/or grader throughout my undergraduate career at Princeton and my graduate career at Penn. Here is a list of my teaching positions in reverse chronological order:

**At Penn**:

- Graduate Cryptography, CIS 5560. Semesters: *Fall 2022*
- Algorithmic Game Theory, NETS 412. Semesters: *Spring 2022, Spring 2021*
- Theory of Algorithms, CIS 320. Semesters: *Fall 2021*

**At Princeton**:

- Complexity Theory, COS 487/MAT 407. Semesters: *Fall 2019*
- Economics and Computing, COS 445. Semesters: *Spring 2019*
- Algorithms and Data Structures, COS 226. Semesters: *Fall 2018, Spring 2018*
- Introduction to Computer Science: An Interdisciplinary Approach, COS 126. Semesters: *Fall 2017*

While at Princeton, I also worked as an individual and study-hall tutor at the [McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning](https://mcgraw.princeton.edu/) while honing my teaching skills through their tutor training sessions. I was a tutor for the following courses:

- Advanced Multivariate Calculus, MAT 203
- Linear Algebra, MAT 202
- Multivariate Calculus, MAT 201

**Volunteer Teaching**: Between 2017 and 2019, I volunteered for the Princeton Splash program organized by the [Pace Center for Civic Engagement](https://pace.princeton.edu/get-involved/splash), where I designed and taught lectures to local (NJ) high-school students in grades 9 through 12. My goal was to introduce them, in an accessible and hopefully inspiring way, to some exciting undergraduate- and graduate-level topics: Theoretical Machine Learning (*Spring 2019*), Algorithmic Game Theory (*Spring 2018*), Quantum Cryptography, and Graph Algorithms (*Spring 2017*).
